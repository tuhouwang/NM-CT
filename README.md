The program `NM_CT.m` computes the range-independent modal acoustic field in
Fig.1 using the Chebyshev-Tau spectral method (`NM_CT`). The method is
described in the article (H. Tu, Y. Wang, Q. Lan et al., A Chebyshev-Tau
spectral method for normal modes of underwater sound propagation with a
layered marine environment, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2020.115784).
We have developed program in Fortran version (`NM_CT.f90`) and Matlab
version (`NM_CT.m`), respectively. Both versions of the program use the
same input file "`input.txt`", '`ReadEnvParameter`' function/subroutine is used
to read "`input.txt`" file. User can make changes to "`input.txt`" for the
desired calculation. It is worth mentioning that the Fortran version of
the program calls the subroutine '`zgeev()`' in the Lapack (a numerical
library) to solve the eigenvalues of the complex matrix. Both the Matlab
and Fortran versions of the program will eventually generate the same
format of the binary sound field file "`tl.bin`", and the
`plot_binary_tl.m` program can be used to read the sound field binary
data and plot.

The initial version of the program was only able to solve for sound 
propagation in a two-layer marine environment with an ideal seafloor. 
It then underwent two major extensions, the first allowing it to solve 
the ocean floor at half-space boundaries, and the second allowing it 
to solve horizontally layered media with any number of layers.

The "`input.txt`" file contains the parameters defining the modal
calculation. See the following example:

The "`input.txt`" file include:

*  `casename` is the name of current example,

*  `Layers` is the number of layers,

* `N1` (the number to truncated
  order of water column), 

* `N2` (the number to truncated order of bottom
  sediment). 

  `N1` and `N2` may be equal or unequal. Generally speaking, the
  more complicated the shape of the sound speed profile, the more `N1` and
  `N2` are needed to accurately fit. `Layers` is how many `N` there are.

* `cpmax` is the maximum phase speed limit, which used to determine how many
  modes are accumulated in the final synthesized sound field, generally
  set by the user according to experience (m/s). 

* `freq` (frequency of sound source, Hz), 

* `zs` (the depth of source, m), 

* `zr` (depth of a special receiver, user used to specify 
  to draw the transmission loss curve of  arbitrary depth, m), 

* `rmax` (the maximum range of horizontal direction, m), 

* `dr` (horizontal discrete step, m),

*  `interface1` (depth of the first layer, m),

*  `interface2` (depth of the second layer, m), `Layers` is how many `interface` there are, 

* `dz` (discrete step size in depth direction, m),

* `tlmin` and `tlmax`
  and `tlmax` are the minmum and maximum value transmission loss,
  respectively, which used to determine the color range of the output
  transmission loss graph, `tlmin` must less than `tlmax`.

* `n1` and `n2` are the amount of environmental profile data in media. 
  There are `Layers` tables of environmental parameter, their units are 
  depth(m), speed(m/s), density(g/cm$^3$) and attenuation (dB/wavelength), 
  with `n1` and `n2` points in each. It is necessary that `dep1(n1)=dep2(1)` 
  where the density usually has a discontinuity. The first entry `dep1(1)=0` 
  is the free surface. The last entry `dep2(n2)=H` determines the total thickness
  of the waveguide. 
  
*  `Lowerboundary` (User used to specify whether the seabottom
  boundary condition is perfectly free 'V', perfectly rigid 'R' or half-space 'A'), 
  The last line is the parameters for the half-space. 

  Note that when using the half-space boundary condition, the attenuation 
  coefficient needs to be set to a positive value for the program to run stably.
